After the degraded ecology of kasi, we set out with the hope that the colony can find a new home in this system. 6800 dels since our arrival, we must look to the rest of the system for a suitable habitat.
Possible targets include the twin ripels or the planet link with it's ancient reactor.

Some colonists have been put in cryo freeze to preserve rations. System engineers are a priority.
