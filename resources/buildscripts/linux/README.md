### note: these scripts assume you have ninja

Run these build scripts from the project root, so they would be ran as 
```
./resources/buildscripts/linux/debug.sh
```
 from the  terminal

if you get permission denied, first give the script executable privileges with
```
chmod +x resources/buildscripts/linux/debug.sh
```

If you change the name of the project in the root CMakeLists.txt, update the scripts to execute the new name of the binary.
