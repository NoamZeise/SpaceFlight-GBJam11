# GB Jam 11 Submission

A weeklong game jam to create a game with the graphical restrictions
of a nintendo gameboy. This means the game must have a resolution of 
```160 x 144```
and use 4 colours.

A 3D space flight sim about exploring a solar system and collection log files. Built using my [graphics environment](https://github.com/NoamZeise/Graphics-Environment.git)
